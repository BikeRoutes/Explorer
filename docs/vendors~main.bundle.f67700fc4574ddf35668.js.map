It\n     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is\n     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling\n     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n     * thought.\n     *\n     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used.

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator\n * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used\n * for notification emissions in general.\n *\n * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>\n * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled\n *                                               // with async scheduler by default...\n *\n * intervals\n * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame\n * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.\n *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';\n * });\n *\n * @see {@link delay}\n *\n * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.\n * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,\n * but with provided scheduler.\n *\n * @method observeOn\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction observeOn(scheduler, delay) {\n    if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n    return function observeOnOperatorFunction(source) {\n        return source.lift(new ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay));\n    };\n}\nexports.observeOn = observeOn;\nvar ObserveOnOperator = (function () {\n    function ObserveOnOperator(scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    ObserveOnOperator.prototype.call = function (subscriber, source) {\n        return source.subscribe(new ObserveOnSubscriber(subscriber, this.scheduler, this.delay));\n    };\n    return ObserveOnOperator;\n}());\nexports.ObserveOnOperator = ObserveOnOperator;\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nvar ObserveOnSubscriber = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(ObserveOnSubscriber, _super);\n    function ObserveOnSubscriber(destination, scheduler, delay) {\n        if (delay === void 0) { delay = 0; }\n        _super.call(this, destination);\n        this.scheduler = scheduler;\n        this.delay = delay;\n    }\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch = function (arg) {\n        var notification = arg.notification, destination = arg.destination;\n        notification.observe(destination);\n        this.unsubscribe();\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype.scheduleMessage = function (notification) {\n        this.add(this.scheduler.schedule(ObserveOnSubscriber.dispatch, this.delay, new ObserveOnMessage(notification, this.destination)));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._next = function (value) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createNext(value));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._error = function (err) {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createError(err));\n    };\n    ObserveOnSubscriber.prototype._complete = function () {\n        this.scheduleMessage(Notification_1.Notification.createComplete());\n    };\n    return ObserveOnSubscriber;\n}(Subscriber_1.Subscriber));\nexports.ObserveOnSubscriber = ObserveOnSubscriber;\nvar ObserveOnMessage = (function () {\n    function ObserveOnMessage(notification, destination) {\n        this.notification = notification;\n        this.destination = destination;\n    }\n    return ObserveOnMessage;\n}());\nexports.ObserveOnMessage = ObserveOnMessage;\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map","\"use strict\";\nvar mergeMap_1 = require('./mergeMap');\nvar identity_1 = require('../util/identity');\n/**\n * Converts a higher-order Observable into a first-order Observable which\n * concurrently delivers all values that are emitted on the inner Observables.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Flattens an Observable-of-Observables.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/mergeAll.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `mergeAll` subscribes to an Observable that emits Observables, also known as\n * a higher-order Observable.

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise$1 = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves.

When the output function\n     * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n     * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.\n     * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n     * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n     *\n     * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called\n     * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, a selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. The selector function\n     * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array\n     * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n     * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n     * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n     * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n     * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n     * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n     * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n     * calls will not appear in the stream.

If that object is passed to callback, it means\n     * something went wrong.\n     *\n     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n     * error with that value as well.

If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n     *\n     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n     *\n     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n     * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n     *\n     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n     * of returned function, when it is called.\n     *\n     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n     * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n     *\n     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n     * with that value.

As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be\n * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that\n * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when\n * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription\n * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,\n * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of\n * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.\n *\n * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,\n * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source\n * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,\n * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count\n * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least\n * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a\n * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.\n *\n * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.\n * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable\n * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this\n * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If\n * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.\n * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,\n * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream\n * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,\n * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.\n *\n * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the\n * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject\n * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use\n * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},\n * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},\n * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually\n * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.\n *\n * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,\n * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());\n *\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));\n * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));\n *\n * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.\n *\n * connectableSeconds.connect();\n *\n * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,\n * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,\n * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.\n *\n * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>\n * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);\n *\n * seconds\n *     .multicast(\n *         () => new Subject(),\n *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.\n *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,\n *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.\n *     .subscribe();\n *\n * @see {@link publish}\n * @see {@link publishLast}\n * @see {@link publishBehavior}\n * @see {@link publishReplay}\n * @see {@link share}\n * @see {@link shareReplay}\n *\n * @param {Function|Subject} subjectOrSubjectFactory - Factory function to create an intermediate Subject through\n * which the source sequence's elements will be multicast to the selector function input Observable or\n * ConnectableObservable returned by the operator.\n * @param {Function} [selector] - Optional selector function that can use the input stream\n * as many times as needed, without causing multiple subscriptions to the source stream.\n * Subscribers to the input source will receive all notifications of the source from the\n * time of the subscription forward.\n * @return {Observable<T>|ConnectableObservable<T>} An Observable that emits the results of invoking the selector\n * on the source stream or a special {@link ConnectableObservable}, if selector was not provided.\n *\n * @method multicast\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector) {\n    return multicast_1.multicast(subjectOrSubjectFactory, selector)(this);\n}\nexports.multicast = multicast;\n//# sourceMappingURL=multicast.js.map","\"use strict\";\nvar Observable_1 = require('../../Observable');\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../../operator/observeOn');\nObservable_1.Observable.prototype.observeOn = observeOn_1.observeOn;\n//# sourceMappingURL=observeOn.js.map","\"use strict\";\nvar observeOn_1 = require('../operators/observeOn');\n/**\n *\n * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>\n *\n * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule\n * notifications emitted by the source Observable.
