## Web Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn web-start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn web-build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />

### `yarn web-deploy`

Runs `yarn build` and then pushes the built app on the gh-pages branch.<br />
The web application is automatically updated by GitHub in a couple of minutes.
